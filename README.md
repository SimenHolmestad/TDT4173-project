# TDT4173-project

The goal of this project is to use the [yelp-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) to predict the number of stars given for a review based on the words used in the review text. We will use word embeddings try different types of machine learning techniques, namely bag-of-words and LSTMs.

The project is hosted on github at <https://github.com/SimenHolmestad/TDT4173-project>.

## About the dataset
The Yelp dataset (<https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset>) contains a wealth of information from Yelp, a popular website for crowd-sourced reviews of various physical establishments. The dataset contains several categories, of which we are interested in one: The reviews. This data set alone is 5.9GB in size, and contains 5,200,000 user reviews. This should be more than enough to train and test our models.
